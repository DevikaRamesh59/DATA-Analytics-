•	Identify top-performing months, years, products, and regions
•	Evaluate category, sub-category, and segment performance
•	Understand customer purchasing patterns
•	Generate:
o	Descriptive insights
o	Diagnostic insights
o	Predictive insights
o	Prescriptive recommendations
•	Showcase Excel + Power BI end-to-end analytics workflow
# Business Problem Statement
